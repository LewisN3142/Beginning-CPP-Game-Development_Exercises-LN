# Beginning C++ Game Programming Second Edition by John Horton

At the recommendation of  a very helpful staff member at Rare Ltd. I have decided to work my way through the Beginning C++ Game Programming book in order to develop my programming skills specific to game development, by creating a series of small games. 
This repository will contain the exercises from this book and will be updated as I complete them. I have chosen to make this repository in order to track my progress and have made it public as a reference for those curious individuals who may want to do the same. 
Note that I may stray from the formal 'solutions' presented by the original text in places while I experiment (I shall do my best to mark these), however should you want to view the 'clean' solutions as it were, they are available on the [official Packt repository](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Beginning-Cpp-Game-Programming-Second-Edition)
