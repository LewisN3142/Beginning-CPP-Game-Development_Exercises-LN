# Beginning C++ Game Programming Second Edition by John Horton

At the recommendation of  a very helpful staff member at Rare Ltd. I have decided to work my way through the Beginning C++ Game Programming book in order to develop my programming skills specific to game development, by creating a series of small games. 
This repository will contain the exercises from this book and will be updated as I complete them. I have chosen to make this repository in order to track my progress and have made it public as a reference for those curious individuals who may want to do the same. 
Note that I may stray from the formal 'solutions' presented by the original text in places while I experiment (I shall do my best to mark these), however should you want to view the 'clean' solutions as it were, they are available on the [official Packt repository](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Beginning-Cpp-Game-Programming-Second-Edition)

Note that if you wish to compile the code locally, you will need to [download SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/download/sfml/2.6.1/). Once you have extracted the files from the accompanying .zip folder, copy and paste them into a folder 'SFML' located at the root of the project directory (in the same folder as the readme/gitignore files). You will also need to set up the linker and C++ compiler appropriately, as described in John Horton's book or any other good appropriate reference.
